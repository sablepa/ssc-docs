# Supply Chain Platform: System Design & Roadmap
----------------------------------------------

This document outlines the proposed architecture, design, and roadmap for a microservices-based supply chain platform catering to small to mid-sized businesses across various sectors like furniture, fitness, and electronics.

### 1\. Project Vision & Goals

*   **Core Functionality:** Enable store front offices to manage customer profiles, create orders, handle shipping, generate receipts, and track order status.
    
*   **Back Office Capabilities:** Provide tools for inventory management, stock control, and order processing from various vendors.
    
*   **Scalability & Reliability:** Design a system that can scale with business growth and ensure data consistency, especially for inventory in a distributed environment.
    
*   **Technology Stack:** Leverage Spring Boot for microservices, Spring Security, centralized configuration, Redis for caching/session management, AWS services (SQS, RDS/DynamoDB, EKS, API Gateway), Docker, and Kubernetes.
    

### 2\. System Architecture

#### 2.1. High-Level Overview

The system will be a collection of independently deployable microservices communicating via REST APIs and asynchronous messaging (AWS SQS). An API Gateway will serve as the single entry point for all client requests (Store Front Office UI, Back Office UI).

### 5\. Key Business Flows

1.  **Store Front Creates User Profile:**
    
    *   Store staff accesses Store Front UI.
        
    *   Enters customer details -> POST /users to User Service via API Gateway.
        
    *   Adds addresses -> POST /users/{userId}/addresses.
        
2.  **Store Front Creates Order:**
    
    *   Staff selects customer, adds products to cart.
        
    *   UI calculates total -> POST /orders to Order Service.
        
    *   Order Service:
        
        1.  Validates request.
            
        2.  (Optional) Creates a temporary stock reservation with Inventory Service.
            
        3.  Saves order in Pending state.
            
        4.  Publishes OrderCreatedEvent to SQS.
            
    *   Inventory Service (consumes OrderCreatedEvent):
        
        1.  Decrements stock for ordered items (using optimistic locking).
            
        2.  If stock unavailable, publishes StockUnavailableEvent (Order Service might listen to update order status or initiate backorder flow).
            
        3.  Publishes StockUpdatedEvent.
            
    *   Notification Service (consumes OrderCreatedEvent):
        
        1.  Sends "Order Confirmed" receipt/notification to the customer.
            
    *   Order Service updates order status to Confirmed.
        
3.  **Inventory Management (Back Office):**
    
    *   Staff views inventory levels (GET /inventory?productId=...&warehouseId=...).
        
    *   Staff updates stock (e.g., new shipment from vendor) -> PUT /inventory/items/{itemId} or POST /inventory/adjustments.
        
    *   Inventory Service updates stock and publishes StockUpdatedEvent.
        
4.  **Order Fulfillment & Tracking:**
    
    *   **Dispatch:**
        
        1.  Back office staff marks order for dispatch.
            
        2.  Triggers Shipping Service -> POST /shipments (associating with OrderID).
            
        3.  Shipping Service generates tracking, updates status to InTransit.
            
        4.  Publishes ShipmentDispatchedEvent to SQS.
            
        5.  Order Service consumes event, updates order status to Dispatched.
            
        6.  Notification Service consumes event, sends "Order Dispatched" receipt/notification with tracking info.
            
    *   **Delivery:**
        
        1.  Shipping Service (receives update from carrier or manual update) updates shipment status to Delivered.
            
        2.  Publishes ShipmentDeliveredEvent.
            
        3.  Order Service consumes, updates order status to Delivered.
            
        4.  Notification Service consumes, sends "Order Delivered" receipt/notification.
            
5.  **Receipt Generation:**
    
    *   Receipts are generated at different stages (Ordered, Dispatched, Delivered).
        
    *   Notification Service can be responsible for compiling receipt data (from Order, Product, User services) and generating it (e.g., PDF or structured email content) upon consuming relevant events.
        

### 6\. Technology Integration Details

*   **Redis Usage:**
    
    *   **Caching:** Product details, user profiles, frequently accessed configurations.
        
        *   _Example:_ Cache product data in Product Service to reduce DB load.
            
    *   **Session Management:** Store user session data for API Gateway/AuthService.
        
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement API rate limits at the API Gateway level, potentially using Redis for counters.
        
    *   **Distributed Locks (Use with Caution):** For short-lived critical sections if optimistic locking is insufficient in Inventory Service, though often database-level optimistic locking or a dedicated distributed lock manager (like ZooKeeper/etcd if already in use) is preferred for robustness. For inventory, event-driven approaches with compensation are generally better.
        
    *   **Leaderboards/Real-time Stats (Future):** If you need to show top-selling products, etc.
        
*   **AWS SQS Usage:**
    
    *   **Decoupling Services:**
        
        *   Order Service publishes OrderCreatedEvent -> Inventory Service & Notification Service subscribe.
            
        *   Inventory Service publishes StockUpdatedEvent -> Potentially other services (e.g., a replenishment service) subscribe.
            
        *   Shipping Service publishes ShipmentStatusChangedEvent -> Order Service & Notification Service subscribe.
            
    *   **Asynchronous Task Processing:**
        
        *   Generating complex reports.
            
        *   Sending bulk notifications.
            
        *   Processing batch inventory updates.
            
    *   **Buffering & Smoothing Load:**
        
        *   During peak order times, SQS can buffer requests to the Inventory Service, preventing it from being overwhelmed.
            
    *   **Dead Letter Queues (DLQs):** Configure DLQs for SQS queues to handle messages that cannot be processed successfully, allowing for investigation and reprocessing.
        
*   **Spring Security:**
    
    *   Implement OAuth2 or JWT-based authentication.
        
    *   Central Authentication Service (or integrated within API Gateway/User Service initially).
        
    *   Role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types (customer, store staff, back-office admin).
        
    *   Secure inter-service communication (e.g., using service accounts or token relay).
        
*   **Docker & Kubernetes (AWS EKS):**
    
    *   Each microservice will be packaged as a Docker container.
        
    *   Kubernetes will be used for deployment, scaling (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler), service discovery, load balancing, and self-healing of services on AWS EKS.
        

### 7\. Addressing Stale Inventory in Distributed Systems

This is a critical challenge. A multi-pronged approach:

1.  **Single Source of Truth:** The Inventory Service is the _only_ service that directly modifies inventory quantities.
    
2.  **Eventual Consistency:** Accept that other services might have slightly delayed views of inventory. The UI should reflect this or manage expectations.
    
3.  // In InventoryItem entity// @Version// private Long version;
    
4.  **Asynchronous Updates via SQS:** When an order is placed, the Order Service can publish an OrderPendingConfirmationEvent. The Inventory Service consumes this, attempts to allocate stock. If successful, it publishes StockAllocatedEvent; if not, StockAllocationFailedEvent. The Order Service listens for these to confirm or reject the order.
    
5.  **Compensating Transactions (Saga Pattern):** For complex operations spanning multiple services (e.g., order creation involving payment, inventory, notification), if one step fails, subsequent steps must be rolled back. Sagas can be implemented using choreography (events) or orchestration (a central coordinator).
    
    *   _Example (Choreography):_ Order Service creates order (pending) -> emits OrderCreated. Inventory Service listens, reserves stock -> emits StockReserved. Payment Service listens, processes payment -> emits PaymentProcessed. If StockReservationFailed or PaymentFailed, compensating events are emitted to roll back.
        
6.  **Reservation System:** Inventory Service can offer an API to temporarily "reserve" stock for a short period (e.g., 5-10 minutes) while a customer completes checkout. If the order isn't confirmed within that window, the reservation expires.
    
7.  **Real-time Communication (Optional, for UI):** For UIs displaying stock, consider WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) fed by the Inventory Service to provide near real-time updates, but this adds complexity. A more common approach is to re-fetch or rely on slightly delayed data with clear indicators.
    
8.  **Atomic Operations where Possible:** If a business has only one front office and one warehouse, some operations can be simpler. The design should cater to the more complex distributed scenario.
    
9.  **Business Logic for Discrepancies:** Define how to handle situations where an order is placed for an out-of-stock item due to staleness (e.g., backorder, offer alternatives, cancel item).
    

### 8\. API Design Examples (High-Level)

**User Service:**

*   POST /api/v1/users (Create user)
    
*   GET /api/v1/users/{userId}
    
*   PUT /api/v1/users/{userId}
    
*   POST /api/v1/users/{userId}/addresses
    
*   GET /api/v1/users/{userId}/addresses
    
*   POST /api/v1/auth/login
    
*   POST /api/v1/auth/register (if self-service registration is allowed)
    

**Product Service:**

*   POST /api/v1/products (Admin only)
    
*   GET /api/v1/products?businessId={businessId}&category={category}&searchTerm={term}
    
*   GET /api/v1/products/{productId}
    

**Inventory Service:**

*   GET /api/v1/inventory/stock?productId={productId}&warehouseId={warehouseId}
    
*   POST /api/v1/inventory/reservations (Reserve stock)
    
*   DELETE /api/v1/inventory/reservations/{reservationId} (Cancel reservation)
    
*   POST /api/v1/inventory/adjustments (Adjust stock levels, e.g., for received goods, discrepancies)
    

**Order Service:**

*   POST /api/v1/orders (Body: { userId, storeId, items: \[{productId, quantity}\], shippingAddressId, billingAddressId })
    
*   GET /api/v1/orders/{orderId}
    
*   GET /api/v1/orders?userId={userId}&status={status}
    
*   PUT /api/v1/orders/{orderId}/status (e.g., cancel order)
    

**Shipping Service:**

*   POST /api/v1/shipments (Body: { orderId, carrier, warehouseId }) -> returns tracking info
    
*   GET /api/v1/shipments/{shipmentId}
    
*   GET /api/v1/shipments/tracking/{trackingNumber}
    
*   POST /api/v1/shipments/{shipmentId}/receipts (Generate dispatch/delivery receipt)
    

**Notification Service (Internal or triggered via events):**

*   (Typically consumes SQS messages, may not have many direct external APIs unless for manual trigger/testing)

### 10\. Security Considerations

*   **Authentication:** Strong authentication mechanisms (OAuth 2.0 / JWT).
    
*   **Authorization:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) at API Gateway and service levels.
    
*   **Data Encryption:** TLS for data in transit. Encryption at rest for databases and S3 (if used).
    
*   **Input Validation:** Rigorous validation at API Gateway and service layers to prevent injection attacks (SQLi, XSS).
    
*   **Secrets Management:** Use AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault for database credentials, API keys.
    
*   **Secure Inter-service Communication:** mTLS or token-based auth between services.
    
*   **Regular Security Audits & Penetration Testing.**
    
*   **OWASP Top 10:** Adhere to best practices.
    

This detailed plan should provide a strong starting point. Remember that this is a high-level design, and many details will be refined during the development process. Agile methodologies will be beneficial to adapt to changing requirements and learnings.
